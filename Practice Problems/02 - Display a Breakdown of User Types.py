# Practice Problem #2: Display a Breakdown of User Types
# There are different types of users specified in the "User Type" column. Find how many there are of each type and store the counts in a pandas Series in the user_types variable.

# Hint: What pandas function returns a Series with the counts of each unique value in a column?

import pandas as pd

filename = 'Python\Explore US Bikeshare Data\chicago.csv'

# load data file into a dataframe
df = pd.read_csv(filename)

# print value counts for each user type
user_types = df['User Type'].value_counts()

print(user_types)
